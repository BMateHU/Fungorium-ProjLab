# Fungorium
A university project, where the students worked in groups of five to make an application.
Fungorium is a game where there are 2 teams: insects and mushrooms.The game has "small islands" and mushroom threads inbetween so insects can move between islands, and mushrooms can extend the threads.
Every player starts with 1 character from their team. The objective is to get the most points, regardless of which team the player belongs to.
